## Owlz! 
*"Create a Hoot!"*

Project 4 for Harvard's CS50w Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

üìπ `Youtube:` ...TBD

### Overview:
A social media site for making posts, following users, and `hooting` out to the world!

-----

### Specifications:
Built with `Javascript`, `Python`, `Django`, `HTML/CSS`, `Bootstrap`, and `SQLite`. 

The site makes use of [Django's](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/humanize/) `humanize` template filters via `naturaltime` as well as [pagination](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/pagination/): displaying 10 posts per page. If there are more than ten posts, `‚ÄúNext‚Äù` takes the user to the next page of posts. If not on the first page, `‚ÄúBack‚Äù` takes the user to the previous page; additionally uses Django's [File uploads](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/file-uploads/) feature for creating a profile image.

-----

### To Run:
1. Pip install `Django`
2. In the terminal, cd into the project4 directory.
3. Run `python3 manage.py makemigrations network` to make migrations for the network app.
